    used function for abstraction but can be done without function

  '''
    if input is in charsOfSelectedWord it will get its index/indices 
    which uses numpy.where which easily gets the indices of the same letter in the list 

    @newList is used for converting mysteryWord into list and changing the _ into proper letter
      and using "".join(newList) to join it into a string again (e.g. M _ C E _ )

    i used index * 2 because mysteryWord has whitespaces between them
    if input letter is in index 3 then in mysteryWord it is index 6
    making them indexFromWord*2 = indexInMysteryWord
    refer to diag below

          M I C E S
    index 0 1 2 3 4
          _ _ _ _ _
    index 012345678

    else: if input letter is in charsOfSelectedWord then it will
      subtract life by 1 
    (life -= 1) is the same as (life = life - 1)
      googled it, its called Compound Assignment or Augmented Assignment
